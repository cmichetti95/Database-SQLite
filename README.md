# Database-SQLite
Created in a group of 3, this was a database project completed using SQLite

The 'CreateQueries', 'CreateViewSQL', and 'IndexSQL' all involve the creation of the database tables. The 'CreateViewSQL' file is the code to create different views.
Also, the "IndexSQL" file is the code to create different types of indexes based on the tables created.

Next, the 'Insert Queries' file inserts a bunch of data into the tables that were created.

Last, the 'InsertDeleteSQL' file along with the three 'Queries" files are all to test the functionality of the database and see if everything was working as intended.
